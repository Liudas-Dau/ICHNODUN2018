Calibration curve: IntCal13.14C
Age-depth model: polynomial regression [type=2] of order 2 [smooth]
Weighted by the calibrated probabilities [wghts=1]
Calculations at 68.2% confidence ranges [prob=0.682]
Amount of iterations: 10000 [its]
Calendar age point estimates for depths based on weighted average of all age-depth curves [est=1]
Calendar scale used: cal BP [BCAD=FALSE] at a resolution of 1 yr [yrsteps]
Ages were calculated every 0.01 [every] cm [depth], from 3.58 [dmin] to 8.5 [dmax] cm 

Goodness-of-fit (-log, lower is better):  4.15 
Any models with age-depth reversals were removed
